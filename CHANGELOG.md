### Introducing resource services
Every entity resource now has its own service definition for handling api communication. With this release, we don't store `contentful client` and `space` objects inside entities anymore. Resource services now get `spaceID` as a string parameter when it is neccessary.

### Create resource instancas directly from their model definitions
